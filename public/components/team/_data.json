Coffee 'N Code is where I try to help others create the same experience for themselves. CNC is, first and foremost, a place of patient and judgement-free learning, where I share industry knowledge and how to self-learn programming. Creating communities is my passion and I want to help my superbly talented team to make CNC a community of motivated learners with a shared goal of levelling up in life.",

And though that might make no sense, I think that’s the beauty of Coffee 'N Code. My interest in starting this club sparked when I attended a Coffee 'N Code meetup hosted in Toronto. It was the first tech-oriented event that helped break down for me the barrier to explore my simple curiosity for programming as someone who had no real past  experience. Since then, my goal was and continues to be to bring this community of open exploration to the UW campus.",
